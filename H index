Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

 class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        citations.sort(reverse=True)
        h=0
        for i,c in enumerate(citations):
            if c>=i+1:
                h=i+1
            else:
                break
        return h
