You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.
another way:nword as array and use join()

class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        i=0
        j=0
        k=0
        nword=""
        while i<len(word1) and j<len(word2):
            nword+=word1[i]
            k+=1
            i+=1
            nword+=word2[j]
            k+=1
            j+=1
        if i<len(word1):
            nword+=word1[i:]
        if j<len(word2):
            nword+=word2[j:]
        return nword
