You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array

class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        freq={}
        count=0

        for num in nums:
            complement=k-num

            if freq.get(complement,0)>0:
                count+=1
                freq[complement]-=1
            else:
                freq[num]=freq.get(num,0)+1
        return count
