Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not


class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        
       sp=0
       tp=0
       count=0

       while sp<len(s) and tp<len(t):
            if s[sp]==t[tp]:
                sp+=1
            tp+=1
       if sp==len(s):
            return True
       else:
            return False
