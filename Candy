There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

Greedy Two-Pass Approach

class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        n=len(ratings)
        arr=[1]*n
        for i in range(1,len(ratings)):
            if ratings[i]>ratings[i-1]:
                arr[i]=arr[i-1]+1
        for i in range(n-2,-1,-1):
            if ratings[i]>ratings[i+1]:
               arr[i]=max(arr[i],arr[i+1]+1)
               
        sum=0
        for i in arr:
            sum+=i
        return sum
