Q)
You are given a string that represent steps in combination of U and D characters.
U represents to take a step up in level. 
D represents to take a step down in level.

You always start at sea level.
A valley is a dip from sea level and back to sea level.
Example:
Input: UUDDDDUDUU
Output = 1

Explanation:
                       *
                      * *
Sea level __ *   *        __ sea level
                           * * *
                            * * --> this is a valley, when reached back to sea level

for i in s:

            if i=='U':

            level+=1
        elif i=='D':
            level-=1
            
print(count)
